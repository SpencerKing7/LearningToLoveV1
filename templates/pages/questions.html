                <h4>What will this mean for my future?</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">I usually feel very stressed when I think about my future because there are so many different ways my life could go. I think that it doesn’t matter as much as I let myself worry about it. I am going to make the best decisions I can in the situation I am in and I am confident that whatever it looks like it will be great!</p>
                
                <br><br>
                <h4>Did I choose to be gay?</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">I definitely did not choose this! After so many years of trying to make the feelings go away I learned that the only thing I could choose was to love myself for who I am. Since I have been able to do that I feel so much happier and confident.</p>
                <br><br>
                
                <h4>How can you be an ally to LGBTQ people?</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">I get that it can be uncomfortable for people who aren’t familiar with LGBTQ topics/experiences to step into this space. I think that uncomfort or fear comes from not understanding the experience. I’ve seen so many people have a huge change of heart once they hear someone’s journey and experiences. I think the most impactful thing people can do is to <i>clearly</i> and <i>strongly</i> show love to LGBTQ people. So many LGBTQ individuals live in fear that their friends or family might not love them if they knew, or don’t approve of, who they are. </p>
                <p class="mb-0">This fear paralyzed me for so many years and even got in the way of developing relationships with people I care about. Please just love love love. Don’t worry so much about the choices others make, try to see them as God sees them and love like He does. My greatest allies are my family and my close friends who have made it very clear that they accept and love me completely, no matter what.</p>

                <h4>Why am I coming out?</h4>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>To be authentic. I don't want to hide anymore</li>
                    <li>For my own personal health and wellness</li>
                    <li>I want to help others</li>
                    <li>I felt prompted by God to come out</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Does this mean I am leaving the church?</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">I am going to be completely honest with this one… I do not know. I feel like I deserve to be happy and comfortable with myself. Sometimes the church causes me anxiety and pain that makes it hard for me to be happy and comfortable with who I am. That makes me want to not be a part of the church. However, the church has done good for me too. I am grateful that through the church I have been able to develop such a close and special relationship with my Heavenly Parents and Jesus Christ. It’s tough when both sides of it are so strong - the good and the bad. It’s a complex thing to figure out so I am making this decision slowly and with lots of thought and prayer.</p>
                <br><br>
                
                <h4>How does it all fit in with the Plan of Salvation?</h4>
                <p class="mb-0">I really wish I had the answer to this question. It is super hard to be working towards an eternity that I have no idea what will be like for me. While the church puts so much emphasis on heterosexual marriages and how that is the way couples will live with God again, I feel like I am excluded because I don’t want to be with a woman. It hurts and makes me confused.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Something that I <i>do</i> know is that my Heavenly Parents have a plan for me. I’m not sure what it is yet, but I know that They are watching over me. I really like the 9th article of faith:</p>
                <p class="mb-0">“We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.” </p>
                <p class="mb-0">I believe that there is so much more truth out there that we just don’t know about yet. But I hope that if we begin asking the right questions and God wants us to know more that He will give more to us. We desperately need more truth, especially regarding LGBTQ individuals and where we fit in the plan.</p>
